## Setup

The first step for installation is to download the Github Desktop application.
Link: https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop

After downloading, log in with your github account and upload the file with Github Desktop.

Then, place the files we sent you from keymaster into the github files you downloaded.

Put the "np-base", "isPed", "np-infinity" scripts into the [cfx] folder.
Open the "config.lua" file in these scripts and place the tokens we gave you to the appropriate files.

Remember, if you try to leak files, it will be bad for you.

After doing all this, open the [SQL] folder in the file and install the database.

You will need 3 subscriptions to run some maps on the server.

2. Subscription - https://store.nopixel.net/category/assets (Crime & Civilian Interior Pack, Government Interior Pack, Sewer Interior Pack)
